# Lunal partners with Impulse AI for Private AI Training, Fine-Tuning, and Inference

*July 23, 2025*

We're excited to announce a partnership with [Impulse AI](https://impulselabs.ai/) to bring confidential, verifiable compute to Impulse's training and inference infrastructure.

Impulse is a protocol to train, fine-tune, and deploy AI models. With Impulse, developers can train, fine-tune, and scale models in minutes on a distributed GPU cloud. It integrates flexible compute, intuitive tooling, and real-time observability to streamline and scale AI training and inference.

This partnership unites Lunal's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) infrastructure with Impulse's protocol and enables:

- End-to-end privacy of prompts and model weights during inference.
- End-to-end privacy of input training data and output model weights during training and fine-tuning.
- Cryptographic verifiability of model training, fine-tuning, and inference.

With Lunal and Impulse, developers get fast, cheap, and trusted AI training, fine-tuning, and inference at global scale.
