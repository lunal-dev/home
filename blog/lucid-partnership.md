We're excited to announce a partnership with [Lucid Computing](https://lucidcomputing.ai/) for trusted AI location verification.

Lucid provides continuous, cryptographic verification of where AI hardware runs and where sensitive data is processed. Rooted in Confidential Computing (CC) hardware, Lucid replaces trust with proof and ensures AI workloads remain compliant with both jurisdictional and export-control boundaries.

This partnership combines Lunal's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) software and tooling with Lucid's location verification framework and enables:

- AI hardware location verification to ensure AI chips operate only in authorized environments
- Data processing location verification to guarantee sensitive data remains within approved jurisdictions only
- Provable compliance at scale to deliver continuous, automated location and data assurances for regulators, partners, and customers

Together, Lunal and Lucid establish trust in AI by anchoring workloads to trusted hardware, securing data in authorized locations, and scaling location verifiability globally.
