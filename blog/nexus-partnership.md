We're pleased to announce a partnership with [Nexus](https://nexus.xyz/) to bring confidential, verifiable compute to the Nexus network.

Nexus is a distributed, zk-powered supercomputer powered by a cutting-edge zkVM, accompanying blockchain, and global network of nodes. By integrating Lunal's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) tooling and infrastructure, zkVM inputs can remain private - including and especially from node operators, Nexus, and Lunal.

This partnership enables:

- Guaranteed privacy of zkVM inputs, where TEEs shield zkVM input data from all parties.
- Integrity and adherence of L1 nodes by running them inside secure, attestable secure enclaves.
- Verifiable source code provenance, where zkVM output proofs can be traced to specific GitHub commits.

With Lunal and Nexus, developers can for the first time deploy private, verifiable computation on encrypted inputs at global scale.
