We're excited to announce a partnership with [Reppo](https://reppo.xyz/) to bring confidential, verifiable compute to Reppo's decentralized network.

Reppo is the resource coordination layer for AI, providing developers, agents, and apps permissionless access to data, compute, and capital. With its solver nodes and data exchange, Reppo enables discovery, negotiation, and access to infrastructure and data. Deployed applications on Reppo's network also gain access to capital through Reppo's native token.

This partnership unites Lunal's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) infrastructure with Reppo's solver nodes and pods and enables:

- End-to-end privacy for Requests for Data (RFDs) on Reppo's data exchange.
- A private and verifiable deployment target for pods on Reppo's network leveraging Lunal's infrastructure.
- Input privacy for Reppo's solver nodes.

With Lunal and Reppo, developers can now coordinate and deploy private, verifiable AI agents, compute, and capital at global scale.
