# TEE Performance on CPUs
September 15, 2025

"What's the catch?" is a common question we get regarding TEEs. What is the performance tradeoff for getting the hardware-level security guarantees that TEEs provide? The de-facto assumption is that there must be significant performance penalties for the strong isolation and encryption that Trusted Execution Environments provide.

We ran the tests and have the answer: **there isn't really a catch**. We ran comprehensive benchmarks comparing identical workloads inside TEE-enabled versus virtual machines, and the results show TEE overhead is remarkably minimal on CPUs, even for the most computationally intensive operations.

## The Bottom Line

Performance difference across multiple metrics hovers around **1.5%**. The largest overhead we observed across any computational stage was **2.08%**.

Here's a table summarizing the key performance metrics when running a proving workload on both TEE-protected and unprotected systems:

| Metric           | TEE Environment | Regular Environment | Performance Difference |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Execution Speed  | 5.16 kHz        | 5.26 kHz            | -1.90%                 |
| Runtime Duration | 89.46s          | 87.78s              | +1.91%                 |
| CPU Utilization  | 26.61%          | 26.23%              | +1.45%                 |
| Memory Usage     | 19.02 GB        | 18.87 GB            | +0.80%                 |

## The Test Setup

We chose to benchmark cryptographic proving systems because they represent some of the most computationally demanding workloads you can run in terms of CPU, and memory utilization. If TEE overhead is negligible for these applications, it will be negligible for almost anything else running on CPUs.

### The Workload: Zero-Knowledge Virtual Machine
The specific system we tested was a zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM) that takes any computer program, executes it, and generates cryptographic proofs of correct execution.

### Proof System Architecture
The zkVM uses STARK (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) proofs backed by the Stwo prover from StarkWare. STARK proofs are particularly demanding because they heavily utilize hashes and involve intensive field arithmetic operations that are resource intensive.

### Test Programs
We benchmarked standard computational workloads including Fibonacci sequence calculations and sorting algorithms.

### Hardware Configuration
- **Processor:** AMD EPYC Series, 4 cores, 32GB RAM
- **TEE Implementation:** AMD SEV-SNP (Secure Encrypted Virtualization - Secure Nested Paging)
- **Comparison:** Identical machines, one with SEV-SNP enabled, one without TEE capabilities

### Benchmark Methodology
The benchmarking process measured four distinct computational phases:

1. **Native Execution:** Direct program execution to establish baseline performance
2. **Program Emulation:** Running the program in a virtual machine to capture its execution trace
3. **Cryptographic Proving:** Generation of mathematical proofs of execution using the ZKPs
4. **Proof Verification:** Checking that the generated proofs are valid

Each test ran multiple iterations to ensure statistical significance, measuring execution speed, duration, and resource utilization across all stages.

## Detailed Performance Breakdown
