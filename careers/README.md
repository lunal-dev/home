# Careers at Lunal

At Lunal, we wake up every day to secure the world's data with secure, private AI.

We believe a small, tenacious team can outrun, outmaneuver, and outperform giants. We live it. To build that team, we're looking for people with grit that get things done and want to be pivotal in an ascendant startup.

We obsess over talent to an unusual degree, and are designing a company that's a haven for self-motivated contributors who want high ownership.

We work together in person in sunny San Francisco, California. We believe in person is the best way to work. We also believe, today, San Francisco is the best place on earth to build an AI company.

We're well capitalized. We raised $7.5M from [Initialized Capital](https://initialized.com/), [Notable Capital](https://www.notablecap.com/), [Soma Capital](https://somacap.com/), and great angels.

We're looking for relentless minds. Interested? Email us at [team@lunal.dev](mailto:team@lunal.dev). We'd love to hear from you.


## 🧱 Software Engineer

Lunal is growing. Fast. And we're looking for software engineers to build the foundations of private, secure, and verifiable compute.

Our team is small, so it’s important you're excited to own large pieces of the whole puzzle.

### What You'll Work on:

As an engineer at Lunal, you'll design distributed systems, deploy infrastructure globally, and ship software daily.

Here are a few examples of the hard problems you'll work on at Lunal:

- Build software for end-to-end private, secure AI inference, training, and fine-tuning.
- Publish open source industry standards for TEEs and TEE attestations.
- Implement Zero Knowledge (ZK) circuits to secure TEEs, keys, and infrastructure.
- Scale infra globally across on prem, bare metal, and every hyperscalar & neocloud.
- Write Linux kernel modules for private logging and telemetry.
- Optimize AI workloads across TEE hardware from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel.
- Build and package software securely in TEEs for attestable builds and supply chain security.
- Collaborate with the TEE hardware vendors on next generation TEE implementations.

### Requirements

Lunal values these traits above all others:

- Consistent: You ship daily.
- Relentless: You find a way or make a way.
- Curious: You thrive in the unfamiliar. New problems energize you.
- Collaborative: People want to work with you. You communicate clearly.

### Qualifications

Thats it. Really. We dont care where, or if, you went to school.

### Bonus Experience

It's a bonus, not a requirement, if you have experience with any of the following:

- Distributed systems
- Cryptography
- Low level systems engineering
- Python, Golang, and/or Rust
- Linux
- Kubernetes
- AMD, Intel, or ARM Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
- NVIDIA Confidential Computing (CC)
- AI inference, training, and/or fine-tuning
