# Careers at Lunal

At Lunal, we wake up every day to secure the world's data with safe, private AI.

We believe a small, tenacious team can outrun, outmaneuver, and outperform lumbering giants. We live it. To build that team, we're looking for people with grit that get things done and want to be pivotal in an ascendant startup.

We work together in person in sunny San Francisco, California. We believe in person is the best way to work. We also believe, today, San Francisco is the best place on earth to build a startup.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
We're well capitalized. We raised $7.5M from top tier investors including [Initialized Capital](https://initialized.com/), [Notable Capital](https://www.notablecap.com/), and [Soma Capital](https://somacap.com/).

Compensation, salary and equity, is top market rate.

We're looking for relentless minds. Interested? Please email us at [team@lunal.dev](mailto:team@lunal.dev). We'd love to hear from you.

### What You’ll Work on:

We have a core list of work streams where engineers will contribute to either one or more. These work streams are focused on TEE infrastructure, cryptography, and build systems. So far, this includes:
=======
### What You'll Work on:

As an engineer at Lunal, you'll design distributed systems, deploy infrastructure globally, and ship software every day.

Here are a few examples of the hard problems you'll work on at Lunal:

- Build software for end-to-end private, secure AI inference, training, and fine-tuning.
- Publish open source industry standards for TEEs and TEE attestations.
- Implement Zero Knowledge (ZK) circuits to secure TEEs, keys, and infrastructure.
- Scale infra globally across on prem, bare metal, and every hyperscalar & neocloud.
- Write Linux kernel modules for private logging and telemetry.
- Optimize AI workloads across TEE hardware from NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel.
- Build and package software securely in TEEs for attestable builds and supply chain security.
- Collaborate with the TEE hardware vendors on next generation TEE implementations.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

- Designing and building software to enable end to end private inference workloads
- Developing attestation standards for TEEs that provide a common API over all current TEE implementations.
- Cryptographic protocols behind secure attestation and key management for TEEs.
- Using Zero Knowledge (ZK) cryptography to develop fully private control plane management of infrastructure. Our usage of ZK is not in the hotpath and is fully scalable with the current performance standards of modern ZK proofs
- A builds and packaging module that utilizes TEEs to fully attest to software build processes.
- And more…
