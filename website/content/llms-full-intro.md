# Confidential — Full Documentation

## TLDR

Confidential runs AI workloads (inference, training, agents) inside hardware-encrypted Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Data and code stay private during processing, can't be tampered with, and both claims are cryptographically verifiable without trusting Confidential. Deploy code unchanged — no performance penalty (~1.5% overhead on CPUs, max 2.08% observed).

**Use Confidential two ways:**
- **Confidential Cloud** — hosted TEE-backed infrastructure: pay-per-token inference, GPU and CPU VMs, attested CI/CD builds (Kettle), and a Confidential Agents API for spinning up private agent environments.
- **Enterprise / Licensed** — deploy the modular component stack on your own infrastructure (on-prem, bare metal, all major clouds).

**Components:** Attestation service, CDS (attestation-gated secrets), attestable build pipeline (SLSA L3), TEE networking (mTLS + multi-recipient hybrid encryption), OHTTP gateway, control plane (with optional ZK proofs), hardened VM image, client/server SDKs. All modular — use individually or together.

**Enterprise model:** Discovery (free) → Pilot (1-4 months, deploy on your infra) → Production. On-prem, bare metal, all major clouds.

**Key benchmarks (AMD EPYC, SEV-SNP, cryptographic proving workloads):**
